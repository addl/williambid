"        <h3>9. HOW THE AUCTIONS WORK</h3>\n"
"        <p>With each bid placed the price of the item on which the user is "
"bidding increases by the amount specified\n"
"            (usually\n"
"            between $0.01 and $0.10). A bid submitted by the user "
"constitutes willingness of a user to enter into a\n"
"            binding\n"
"            contract with Williambid and in the event of a successful "
"finishing of an auction, the claim to receive a\n"
"            purchase\n"
"            offer for the item of the auction under the conditions set out "
"in the related auction. A contract to\n"
"            purchase the\n"
"            item does not come into effect until the auction is finished and "
"the last bidder has followed all the steps\n"
"            as set\n"
"            forth in clause number 10.</p>\n"
"\n"
"        <p>Each new bid resets the ‘remaining time’ for an auction up to, "
"but not above, the displayed countdown reset\n"
"            value\n"
"            (usually, 10, 15 or 20 seconds). The one exception to this rule "
"is when two BidButlers bid against one\n"
"            another. For\n"
"            more information, please consult the ‘Help’ section. The auction "
"ends when the remaining time reaches zero.\n"
"            The user\n"
"            who was the last to bid then wins the auction. All other bids "
"placed on the item expire and will not be\n"
"            credited\n"
"            back to the user's account or be eligible for a refund.</p>\n"
"\n"
"        <p>Bids become valid when they are entered in the database and "
"registered in Williambid’ system. Williambid are\n"
"            not\n"

"            includes,\n"
"            but is not limited to, incorrect count-down of the remaining "
"time, outdated information on bidders, and\n"
"            bids.\n"
"            Williambid reserve the right to pause all auctions, change the "
"bidding time of on- going auctions and open\n"
"            closed\n"
"            auctions on suspicion of disruptions in operations.</p>\n"
"\n"
"        <p>The value of the products is based on an average price offered by "
"local suppliers. Williambid cannot\n"
"            guarantee that\n"
"            a corresponding product is available elsewhere at a lower or "
"higher price.</p>\n"

"            confirmation e-mail. The item will not be sent to the user until "
"the total price has been paid to\n"
"            Williambid. A\n"

"            registration cost\n"
"            and/or any other cost not expressly mentioned on the site shall "
